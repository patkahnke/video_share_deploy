Video Share
==================
Video Share enables users to share videos with one another, vote on the videos,
and view the videos in lists that are ordered along various parameters. It contains:

 - A custom module, "Proof API," that consumes the Proof API for CRUD commands and displays the videos.
 - A custom theme, "Videos."

Please see the README.txt file in the Proof API module for a detailed description.
